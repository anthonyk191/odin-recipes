            <h2>Summary</h2>
            This is one of the most common Chinese household dishes. You almost never find this dish in restaurants because it takes a long time to cook and because it is gloriously fatty. Serve with steam rice and your choice of vegetables.
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 pounds pork belly, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup Shaoxing rice wine</li>
                <li>1/4 cup light soy sauce</li>
                <li>4 scallions, halved</li>
                <li>4 sliced fresh ginger</li>
                <li>4 star anise pods</li>
                <li>water to cover</li>
                <li>1/2 (8 ounce) package vegetarian chicken substitute, diced (Optional)</li>
                <li>6 hard-boiled eggs, peeledd (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add pork belly; cook until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil and brown sugar in a wok or large skillet over medium heat until sugar is melted. Add pork; cook until browned on all sides, about 2 minutes. Add dark soy sauce; cook and stir until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer pork mixture to a slow cooker. Add rice wine, light soy sauce, scallions, ginger, and star anise. Pour in enough water to just cover the pork.</li>
                <li>Cook on Low until pork is tender, about 6 hours. Add diced chicken substitute, hard-boiled eggs, and more water to cover.</li>
                <li>Cook on Low until eggs absorb cooking liquid, rotating halfway through, about 1 hour more.</li>                
            </ol>
